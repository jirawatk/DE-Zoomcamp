## Data lake vs Data warehouse
* **Data lake** used to store raw, unprocessed data flowing directly from an organizationâ€™s various operational and transactional systems and other sources of internal or external data. Picture an actual lake fed by a variety of sources
* **Data warehouse** used to store refined, processed data. This means that the data being stored has already been cleansed and categorized. Picture a typical warehouse: The product/data is processed and packaged before being stored in its assigned area.

## ETL vs ELT
* ETL start from extract data and put it in staging area wait for transform then load to data warehouse
* ELT is new process way to load data to destination source before transform
